# Stereo Depth Estimation Using Deep Learning Techniques

- This project uses the PSMNet from <https://github.com/JiaRenChang/PSMNet>.
- We modified the ```test_img.py``` to be able to run it our personal laptops and get the same results. The original file uses too much VRAM. We also removed deprecated code from original files and replaced with new code.
- Our test images can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iGWg-sPOe-wHnz1FMgf9XE2Q3r7nY82s?usp=drive_link.
- The output images can be viewd at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RZXVVx6S3FUtkuV2GE0satdyz2YSq9kn?usp=drive_link.
- we didn't add the pretrained datasets here because they're large files. However, they can be downloaded from the links provided original repository.
